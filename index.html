            In the academic year of 2024, I was awarded for the best project of
            the year with my final year project.
          </h2>
          <p>
            I developed a website for my computer science department, which
            includes department details, faculty information, student profiles,
            department facilities, and a login/register system for students. The
            project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, with
            PHP handling the backend, and a MySQL database storing all data,
            including students' study details to aid their academic progress.
